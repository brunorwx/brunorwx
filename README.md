Software engineer focused on **systems design**, correctness, and maintainable architectures.

Experience in frontend/backend and distributed systems, with growing interest in systems programming, memory safety, and performance-aware design.

I work mainly with **C#**, **Go**, and **TypeScript**, building predictable, well-tested systems, and use **Python** for data-driven and ML/AI workloads.
